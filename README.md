Recognised different facial expression e.g. Happy,Sad, Anger and Fear etc. using Convolutional Neural Network Model. Used Kaggle website dataset for the testing and training . 

To reduce the over fitting of model, used different techniques like Dropout and Batch normalization in addition to L2 regularization. 
Cross Validation technique was used to evaluate the performance of model.
